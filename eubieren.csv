536,100537,Brouweru Van Steenberge Golden Draak,1713,4.689000000000004,Beer,Ale,3,9,"The legend says the gilded dragon first featured on the prow of the ship with which the Norwegian king Sigrid Magnusson left on a crusade in 1111. He offered the statue to the emperor of Constantinople (the current Istanbul) to put it on the cupola of the Aya Sophia. Some hundred years later, the Flemish count Baldwin IX had the showpiece transported to our regions. Here, the Norwegian dragon ended up in the hands of Bruges. After the battle on the field of Beverhout in 1382, the inhabitants of Ghent took the dragon as war booty and put it on top of their Belfry. In the Belfry all communal charters were kept. The dragon had to protect these documents and it was also the symbol of the freedom and might of the city.    Such an imposing symbol that has lasted for over 6 centuries needs an equally imposing beer. Like the dragon shines at the top of the city, the Gulden Draak is part of the international top of beers. It is a dark triple, which in itself makes it an exceptional beer. But it is the complex taste with hints of caramel, roasted malt and coffee in combination with the creamy hazel head that makes it unique. It is a beer that is worthy of its name.    Like the other special beers of the Brewery Van Steenberge, Gulden Draak is a high fermentation beer with secondary fermentation. For the secondary fermentation, wine yeast is used. This also contributes to the unparalleled taste.    And of course, a unique beer deserves a unique presentation. That’s why Gulden Draak is presented in a white bottle. The white bottle, the black banner, the golden dragon and the red letters, constitute a stylish result that has no equal among the many Belgian special beers.    Gulden Draak can be drunk as an aperitif or dessert, or whenever you have the time to sit back and relax. But this barley wine is also perfect with and in stews, especially the Ghent variety. It is also a plus in sauces for red meat, such as a bordelaise. It is particularly suited as a dessert beer, especially in combination with dark chocolate.    Tip: Replace the whisky in Irish coffee by Gulden Draak or have Gulden Draak with Pas de Bleu: surprising and typical for Ghent. You will be amazed.

process, extra hop cones are added at a later stage in the brewery process (during the lagering
process). This intensifies and refines the hop aromas in the finished beer. The aromatic third hop is

IPAs, short for India Pale Ale is a beer characterized by its hoppy character and popularity in the craft beer scene. It was actually invented as a solution to provide beer for the British Empire in the east. To get beer from London to India without spoiling, a brewer named Hodgson invented a heavily hopped beer to survive the journey. Not only did it survive, it actually improved in flavor over time. Thus, the beginnings of the IPAs that are known and loved today were born. Today, IPAs come in a number of styles including British, West Coast, New England, and East Coast, to name a few.

So when these dudes were invited to the Copenhagen Beer Celebration it was only natural for us to invite them to Amager also. And naturally the style chosen for our collaboration had to be a Farmhouse Saison, a style that Prairie has very much excelled at brewing.

When we visited New England in June 2013, it was therefore only natural that we passed Shaun's farm brewery Hill Farmstead - absolutely in the middle of nowhere.

The color is dark brown on the way to the black, but by using a special technique we have avoided the burnt tones that usually accompany the dark painted.

As a result, the inventive innkeeper had a special Kwak glass blown that could be hung on the coach. In this way the coachman had his Kwak beer safely at hand.

LOOK:
Kwak is recognisable by its deep bright amber colour and a dense, creamy coloured head. The pale wood of the glass holder makes a pleasant contrast with the beer.

SMELL:
You will smell a mellow, fruity and malty aroma with a slightly spicy character (coriander, hops). Additional earthy and very subtle aromas of banana and perhaps also a whiff of pineapple or mango in the background.

TASTE:
Discover a very mellow, fruity attack, a nougat-like solidity, and a slightly spicy character with hints of liquorice passing into a warm finish that reminds you of caramelised banana.

Farmhouse ales, or Saisons, are a type of beer that originated in the French-speaking region of Belgium in the late 1700s. Saison translates to 'season' in french.

Characterized by their light, fruity, spicy, and sometimes sour flavor profiles, with a moderate alcohol content. You'll find this beer varietal can range in color from pale yellow to dark amber and its aromas contain notes of citrus, pepper, and other spices.

You’re no doubt wondering where the name comes from and what the hell the foreign text says. It’s all been explained to us by the brewers, but we’re still not entirely clear about it. What we can understand is that a young Flemish man has gone and married a French-speaking Wallonian girl, and his father, Taras Boulba, is very angry. (Smeirlap means ‘fool’ in a bizarre local dialect, which combines Flemish and French, somehow.)

This is all a bastardization of the original story by Gogol, whose protagonist was Ukrainian and Eastern Orthodox. His son marries a Polish girl, a Roman Catholic, during the religious war between the two countries in the 1600s, and the Ukrainian father simply kills his son to eliminate the shame.

It was also a unique opportunity to create some interesting brews, so why not try it? Therefore we went ahead. We did the main work ourselves and kept the scale of the brewery as it was. Since then, the brewery and its beers have been an inspiration for a lot of brewers. Oerbier is brewed from all different malts, Poperinge Golding hops in flowers and a special yeast which makes it a little tart, especially with aging. At the brewery we have excellent cellars which have a constant temperature of 8°C allowING Oerbier to age at its best.

Golden ale, also known as blonde ale, is a light and refreshing beer style, characterized by its golden yellow to light copper color.

The flavor profile of a blonde ale can vary widely, depending on the hop variety and amount used, and the yeast strain used. Common flavors include lemon, pear, honey, apple, and toffee.

New England / Hazy IPA is a style of beer that has become increasingly popular in recent years. The New England / Hazy IPA (India Pale Ale, for the long version) is characterized by a hazy, slightly opaque appearance and a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. There's a number of beers in this category that are lovingly called juice bombs, because they flavor feels like the perfect combination of orange juice and beer. Thank us later. The flavor is a complex balance of hop bitterness and hop aromas of tropical and citrus fruits, with a hint of malt sweetness. The malt in this beer variety provides a light body and smooth finish that is complemented by light bitterness that doesn't overly linger. You'll find that many, if not most NEIPAs have a higher ABV than other IPA varietals, usually between 5.5% - 7.5% ABV.",Bristol,United Kingdom,6.5,55.0,,,,"Spicy Thai curry, Grilled chicken tacos, Mango habanero wings",Snifter/Goblet/Chalice,45-50° F,7.2-10.0° C,,,IPA,New England / Hazy IPA,Canned Heat Craft Beer

Named “Dorée” for its delicate golden color, this refreshingly crisp ale brings a delicious balance of citrus and spice. A fluffy white head releases the aromas of summer fruits followed by sparkling mouthfeel which ends with a hint of bitterness.

Chimay Première – 7.0% ABV

The beer gives forth distinct apricot aromas and has a pleasantly light and silky mouthfeel which finishes with a touch of bitterness. At 7% alcohol the more subtle esters of Chimay’s yeast strain emerge nicely which gives the perception of a variety of fruits. This yeast strain was isolated by reverend Father Theodore following his studies at brewing school in Leuven after WWII. It was an important achievement in brewing and set Chimay’s reputation for consistency, quality and innovation that remains today.

Chimay Cinq Cents – 8.0% ABV

Cinq Cents has a typical golden color, a slightly hazy appearance topped with a fine foam which releases a bouquet of fruity esters and floral-hop aromas. Mellow flavors of muscat, golden raisins and fresh bread are perfectly balanced by the distinct hoppy bitterness.

Grande Réserve – 9.0% ABV

The beer is remarkably dry for the style and the hint of sweetness is derived purely from the highest quality of malts. Flavors of dates, fig and pear are complimented by aromas of dark bread, with a touch of rose.

There’s no lace and no life to speak of, leaving something to be desired at least from a visual perspective.

As for the taste, the 2012 vintage gives off the impression of a beer that was probably a lot better fresh. While fruit esters are still somewhat prevalent, other than the aroma and taste of raisins and brown sugar, there just isn’t much else to talk about. Even the palate has a sort of hollow edge to it, being dry and a slightly chewy with a mild bitterness and a hint of finishing warmth. Taken together, this string of lackluster descriptors tell the story of this beer.

Special emphasis was placed on using ingredients from both Belgium and Michigan in designing this beer. Michigan is renowned for producing sour, dark cherries of superior quality, and a significant quantity of cherry juice was added to the brew. Deep hued Belgian candi sugar adds to the complex flavor of the beer. The sugar used for bottle conditioning came from native Michigan sugar beets. A finishing fermentation with vinous Brettanomyces strain of yeast complements the unique New Zealand hop variety, Nelson Sauvin. The result is broadly a cherry infused ’mash-up’ of the porter and dubbel styles, brewed to an original gravity of 1.072 and fermented with multiple strains of yeast. Each ingredient used brings a subtle hint of a varied fruit such as plum/prune from the roasted malts; gooseberry/grape from the hops; pear/banana from the yeast and specialty sugar; and of course cherry.

IPAs, short for India Pale Ale is a beer characterized by its hoppy character and popularity in the craft beer scene. It was actually invented as a solution to provide beer for the British Empire in the east. To get beer from London to India without spoiling, a brewer named Hodgson invented a heavily hopped beer to survive the journey. Not only did it survive, it actually improved in flavor over time. Thus, the beginnings of the IPAs that are known and loved today were born. Today, IPAs come in a number of styles including British, West Coast, New England, and East Coast, to name a few.

The flavor is a complex balance of hop bitterness and hop aromas of tropical and citrus fruits, with a hint of malt sweetness. The malt in this beer variety provides a light body and smooth finish that is complemented by light bitterness that doesn't overly linger.

The gold-coloured specialty beer is aged for nine months in oak bourbon barrels. The barrels come from renowned American bourbon distilleries: Four Roses Distillery, Woodford Reserve, Jack Daniels, Heaven Hill and George Dickel.

The barrels are still saturated with the original bourbon and this creates a slightly stimulating Duvel mouthfeel with powerful notes of bourbon, vanilla and caramel. Duvel Barrel Aged is a unique 11.5% ALC tasting beer with a sensational flavour that’s delicious in combination with raw or smoked fish, sushi, grilled or smoked meat, cheeses, exotic fruit and chocolate.

Duvel Barrel Aged stands for refined enjoyment, shared with friends and family, and is perfect for serving at the end of a festive meal.

As the beer will mature for a longer period, this “barrel-aged” Duvel will be darker in color than the traditional Duvel, with a higher alcohol percentage and less bitterness.

The barrels that were selected have had a long life and can boast a real evolution in terms of taste. The oak bourbon barrels originate from two distinguished American bourbon distilleries: the Four Roses Distillery in Kentucky (nominated 'distiller of the year' in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015) and the Buffalo Trace Distillery in Kentucky('most award winning distillery in the world').

New England / Hazy IPA is a style of beer that has become increasingly popular in recent years. The New England / Hazy IPA (India Pale Ale, for the long version) is characterized by a hazy, slightly opaque appearance and a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. There's a number of beers in this category that are lovingly called juice bombs, because they flavor feels like the perfect combination of orange juice and beer. Thank us later. The flavor is a complex balance of hop bitterness and hop aromas of tropical and citrus fruits, with a hint of malt sweetness. The malt in this beer variety provides a light body and smooth finish that is complemented by light bitterness that doesn't overly linger.

Top fermentation – Amber-coloured – Spéciale Belge Ale
Recognised local product – 5.2% ABV

Unique amber-coloured malts determine the basic flavour of PALM: mild caramel flavours with a honey-like mellowness. The malting process adheres to PALM’s specific instructions, which aim for the natural caramelisation that gives the beer its specific flavour.

The aroma is determined to a significant extent by yeast. Through intensive selection, the Van Roy family has amassed a lavish collection of the various yeast strains, each of which gives the beer its own fruity character. PALM is fermented with a specific yeast strain which provides a distinct banana fruitiness.

Since its relaunch, Seefbier, with it's accessible yet distinctive taste and aroma, has won the harts of many beer lovers, and has become one of the most rewarded Belgian Beers of the last years, with 7 times the title of 'World's Best' or Gold on different international beer competitions, including World Beer Cup, World Beer Awards (3X in a row), Brussels Beer Challenge and Global Craft Beer Awards.

Farmhouse ales, or Saisons, are a type of beer that originated in the French-speaking region of Belgium in the late 1700s. Saison translates to 'season' in french.

Characterized by their light, fruity, spicy, and sometimes sour flavor profiles, with a moderate alcohol content. You'll find this beer varietal can range in color from pale yellow to dark amber and its aromas contain notes of citrus, pepper, and other spices. This is because they're often brewed with spices like coriander, pepper, and other herbs, and are served with a slice of orange.

Golden ale, also known as blonde ale, is a light and refreshing beer style, characterized by its golden yellow to light copper color. It's known for its crispness and drinkability, and low to moderate malt character. It's usually lightly hopped, giving it a mild bitterness that is well balanced with its delicate malt flavor. The flavor profile of a blonde ale can vary widely, depending on the hop variety and amount used, and the yeast strain used. Common flavors include lemon, pear, honey, apple, and toffee. This style of beer is typically low in alcohol, ranging from as low as 3-4% ABV to as high as 5.5% ABV.

13825,113831,Harviestoun Ola Dubh Beer 18 Yr Old,4004,3.4819999999999998,Beer,Ale,15,32,"Note: This beer is 8% ABV in bottle, 10.5% in cask and keg.

Ola Dubh 18 (pronounced ‘ola-doo’ and Gaelic for ‘black oil’) is what you get when you age Old Engine Oil in casks formerly used to mature Highland Park 18 (‘Best Spirit in the World’), which imparts a fruity, whisky character into our rich, dark beer.

Ola Dubh was conceived in 2007. It was the first ale to be matured in whisky barrels from a named distillery and, with traceable casks and numbered bottles, it is a beer with real provenance. To make Ola Dubh 18, we take our Old Engine Oil (amped up to 10.5%) and age it for up to 6 months in casks that previously held Highland Park 18 Year Old single malt. And it is ready only when our head brewer, Stuart, deems it ready!

The initial whisky hit on the nose gives way to more delicate aromas of chocolate, fruity coffee grounds and hints of woodland berries. The flavour is a very appetising blend of sweet malts, vanilla, oak and tobacco. It has undertones of raisins and other dark, dried fruits; a delicious testament to Highland Park’s bias toward sherry casks.
